This page is purely experimental, as I have never used Github Page before, nor have I ever used Jekyll in my life.

Here, I would like to thank [田琦 / Tian Qi](https://tianqi.name/blog/about.html) for his wonderful template that I am using right now, its name is TeXt.

## Mathjax test

This is an inline expression $x^2$.

This is a function

$$x=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.$$

Today is the last day of 2021, I sincerely wish for a better world the upcoming year.
