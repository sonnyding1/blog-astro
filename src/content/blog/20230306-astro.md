## Table of contents

## Introduction

This Astro template is created by [Sat Naing](https://satnaing.dev/blog), the template's name is [AstroPaper](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/).

## Functionalities

Code blocks OK:

```python
def main():
    print('hello world!')
```

Math kind of OK:
$$y=x^2$$
I simply imported Mathjax into this page.

```js
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
<script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
```

Of course, since I'm writing in Markdown, common features work.

### This is H3!

## Conclusion

Doesn't look bad at all. But I do plan on designing my own website for once in the future, just for the sake of education. At this point, I am pretty much clueless about front-end frameworks and such. I also look forward to integrating a headless CMS just for that extra bit of convenience (e.g. copy pasting current time no more).
